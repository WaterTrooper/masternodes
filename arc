Arctic Goldminenode instructions (Cold wallet VPS with Windows wallet)
Here are some basic instructions on how to set up an Arcticcoin Goldminenode on a VPS with a cold
wallet and a remote Windows wallet (Works with Linux qt wallet in the same way). Cold wallet means
that your ARC are stored on your local wallet and the local wallet controls the Goldminenode on the
VPS. There are no coins on the VPS and the VPS does not need the private keys to your wallet.
You need:
1. A local PC/Laptop with ARC Windows qt wallet installed and synced
2. A VPS with Ubuntu 16.04
3. Minimum 1.000 ARC in your Windows wallet
1) Install the VPS and the Arctic Daemon:
First we need to prepare the VPS and do some basic security steps. Use Putty to connect to your VPS
with your root login details.
ï‚· Add user with sudo privileges
For security reasons, it is not recommended to run the Arctic daemon as root user, so we setup a new
user with sudo privileges:
adduser <yourusername>
for example: adduser user
